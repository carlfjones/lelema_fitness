                <h2>"Having not grown up as a particularly sporty or active kid, 
                becoming a fitness and movement coach was completely unpredictable."</h2> 
                I had a very loose interest in dance and gymnastics but let me tell
                you I never excelled. I remember prancing around in hand-me-down 
                tutu's as a toddler on the sofa and joining a dance club in high 
                school, which lets face it was really just a social club! I did 
                gymnastics in primary school and the most impressive thing I could 
                do was kick out of a wheel...with a few mattresses stacked under my 
                feet.<br><br>

                Fast forward into my early 20's, post uni. I was rushing to meet some 
                friends in Leicester square so I walked up the escalator as fast as I 
                could...I tried...but my lungs made me pause. <h3>That was the beginning 
                of my fitness journey and it was onwards and upwards from there.</h3> At 
                the start I began working out at home, and I swore I would never go to 
                a gym because I'd always heard they were bacteria city. I found the at 
                home Insanity workouts and began my obsession with wanting a 6 pack 
                like Shaun T promised.<br><br>

                It's been quite a journey, from wanting to be Miss Skinny 6 pack abs 
                to <h2>"ARNIE IS FITNESS"</h2>I could lift some real heavy weights after my first
                year of serious weight training but it came at a cost. I was burning 
                the candle at both ends and my back didn't hold up, but I looked great
                and was strong AF. So eventually my endless desire to understand the
                human body, especially my own has led me to today. I've learnt so 
                much from my own injuries and experiences which has made me into the 
                competent coach that I am proud to be now. <h3>Exploring all the ways in 
                which the human body can move, with control, without injury, to feel 
                good and strong is the path I'm on right now.</h3>
